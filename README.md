# UDP-Based "Guess the Number" Game 🎯

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a simple LAN-based multiplayer **"Guess the Number"** game implemented using **UDP sockets in C**. The server generates a random number, and clients try to guess it by sending guesses over the network. The server responds with hints ("Higher", "Lower", or "Correct") until the correct number is guessed.

## 🖥️ Platform

- **Language:** C
- **Networking:** BSD Sockets (UDP)
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu Linux (via Windows Subsystem for Linux - WSL)
- **Compiler:** GCC

## ⚙️ Build Instructions

```bash
gcc guess_server.c -o guess_server
gcc guess_client.c -o guess_client
```

## ▶️ Run Instructions

### 🖥️ Start the Server

```bash
./guess_server
```

### 💻 Start the Client

```bash
./guess_client
```

## 🌐 Networking Notes

- Communicates over **UDP on port 12345**
- Defaults to `127.0.0.1` (localhost). Change `SERVER_IP` in `guess_client.c` to connect across machines on the same LAN.

---

## ✅ Features

- Random number generation
- Terminal-based client-server interaction
- Sequential handling of multiple clients

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- Ensure the server is running before the client
- If testing on LAN, allow UDP on port 12345
- Check for typos or firewall blocking
